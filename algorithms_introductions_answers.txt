Amazon's "recommendations" algorithm - Amazon invented the recommendations algorithm to personalize their customer's page based off of what their buying habits are. Since they came out with this about two decades ago, so many companies have adapted it and made their own implementations of it.

Uber's algorithm that matches driver with rider - these two companies disrupted the taxi industry with their apps and driver to rider matching functionality/location tracking. The ease of use of their apps have made traditional taxis a thing of the past. 

Google Maps algorithm that allows you to easily get directions from one location to the other - There is nothing out there equivalent to Google Maps that allow you to calculate how to get somewhere using all methods of transportation - walking, biking, driving, bus/train, plane. There are so many websites that use Google Maps and it makes getting around so much easier.

3. An efficient algorithm is one that has clear steps and gets you to the end solution as quickly as possible. Efficient algorithms use effective methods to solve a problem and use as little working memory as possible. An inefficient algorithm is the exact opposite; the steps to the end solution are unclear, it takes more time than is needed to get to the solution, and also uses more space than what is needed.
