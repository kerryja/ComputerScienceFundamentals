c.

  return person === 'Josh';
});

d. 

function findPerson(arr) {
  return arr.find(person => person === 'Emily');
}

findPerson(['Vivian', 'Ava', 'Josh', 'Patrick', 'Mike']);

e.

2. Another real-world example that can be modeled using a data structure would be a teacher keeping track of her student's grades on tests. This would have to be modeled using an array of  student objects, each object containing name and grade arrays.

3. The different methods used would be:

  addStudent(name)
  removeStudent(name)

  addGradeToStudent(name, grade)
  removeGradeFromStudent(name, grade)

  findStudentGrades(name)
